  caveats <<~EOS
    golauncher is not notarized by Apple (it is ad hoc signed), so macOS
    blocks it the first time it opens and may again after an upgrade. Open it
    once, then choose System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway.

    It does not update itself: Homebrew does. Upgrade it with
      brew upgrade --cask golauncher
    and then quit and reopen it.
